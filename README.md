# Examining the Effectiveness of Interventions for Criminal Justice-involved Women: A Meta-Analytic Review
## Introduction
The current study will seek to understand the effectiveness of gender ‘responsive’ (or sensitive) interventions in reducing recidivism of women offenders in direct comparison to gender neutral interventions.  In doing so, it will extend the original meta-analysis conducted by Gobeil et al. (2016) to investigate the treatment effects for specific gender responsive interventions that target the well-established causal factors of female offending, again to determine those that appear to have the greatest impact on recidivism.  This analysis will explore contextual factors such as intervention setting and offence type that might influence the success or otherwise of these interventions.

The current study protocol was uploaded to the Open Science Network (OSN) on 01/26/23 and was updated 15/09/23. The protocol, code and supplementary materials can be found on the OSF (https://osf.io/jqp52/).

## Code Documentation
A considerable change in the method has led to a re-write of the analysis.
The "Nuke and restart.R" script was used to archive outputs, corresponding to Version 1 of the analysis.
Code was branched and V2 analysis commenced.
